## Introduction
Becoming a software engineer can be overwhelming! You will hear so many different languages and frameworks being mentioned that you may think, what on earth have I signed myself up for. 

But dont worry, We have **all** been there 🙋🏼‍♂️. 

I have purposely designed this demo project to take you through the **basics** and slowly move onto more advanced concepts as we progress our skills and when it feels right, instead of throwing everything at you all at once.  

## Course Structure 
A break down of the course is: 
- **Project Brief**  - Here we will describe what we are going to be building together, I will show you the completed project Blue Peter style.

- **Static HTML/CSS site** - We will cover the badics of HTML and CSS, we will understand how they work together
  
- **Vue.js refactor** - We will convert our static site into a Vue.js app. We will discuss the advantages to this as well as cover the basics of Vue.js
  
- **Laravel API** - We wil create a seperate project which our Vue.js app can communicate with
  
- **Further Advancements** - We will discuss how we can build upon the skills we have learnt in the previous chapters can be utlised to add brand new features/functionality to our app.
