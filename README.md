# üëãüèª Hi, hello and welcome to the team!
![image](https://github.com/michaelbarley/new-starter-demo-project/assets/50404794/d2b1d5d4-cbc1-4d8b-8671-4abe42e71f30)

## Introduction
Becoming a software engineer can be overwhelming! You will hear so many different languages and frameworks being mentioned that you may think, what on earth have I signed myself up for. 

But dont worry, We have **all** been there üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

I have purposely designed this demo project to take you through the **basics** and slowly move onto more advanced concepts as we progress our skills and when it feels right, instead of throwing everything at you all at once.  

## Course Structure 
A break down of the course is: 
- **Project Breif**  - Here we will describe what we are going to be building together, I will show you the completed project Blue Peter style.

- **Static HTML/CSS site** - We will cover the badics of HTML and CSS, we will understand how they work together
  
- **Vue.js refactor** - We will convert our static site into a Vue.js app. We will discuss the advantages to this as well as cover the basics of Vue.js
  
- **Laravel API** - We wil create a seperate project which our Vue.js app can communicate with
  
- **Further Advancements** - We will discuss how we can build upon the skills we have learnt in the previous chapters can be utlised to add brand new features/functionality to our app.

# Static HTML/CSS site
By the end of this section you will have a fully functionl ecommerce landing page written in HTML & CSS! Lets do this üöÄ

## 1. Folder Setup 
1. Open Finder (located usually on your dock)
2. in the finder window click on `Documents`
3. Right click (on mac, right click is sometimes disabled you may have to two-finger click on the lower right of your trackpad) and click on `New Folder`
4. Name this folder `Shoes`
5. Click into `Shoes` folder and create a new folder named `image`
6. go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VCFjiogucrQHMW24E_EqDw3L18cfJNLz?usp=share_link. Shift click all the images, then right click and download
7. once the images have donwloaded they should appear if you Navigate to `Downloads` in finder.
8. Drag and drop all those downloaded images into your `Documents/Shoes/image` directory

## 2. index.html
Now lets create our first HTML file.

### What is HTML
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

1. Drag `Shoes` folder into your code editor of choice (this will open the folder up in a code editor)
2. Within your code editor (i'm using Visual Studio Code) Right click outside the `image` folder and select `new file` name this file `index.hmtl`

### Whats index.html
The file named index.html is often the first file that is loaded when a user navigates to a website. This convention originated from the early days of the internet and has stuck around due to its widespread usage and support.

Here are a few reasons why index.html is usually the first HTML file in a web project:

**Default Entry Point**: When a URL points to a directory and not a specific file (like https://www.example.com/), the web server looks for a default file to serve. This file is usually called index.html. It's like the homepage or the front door of your website.

**Convention**: It's a widely adopted convention. Most web developers, hosting services, and server configurations adhere to this practice, making it a standard across the industry. Following this convention ensures compatibility and reduces confusion.

**Ease of Use**: When the main file of a website is named index.html, other developers (or even the future version of you) can easily understand where to look for the primary HTML file. This enhances maintainability and collaboration.

In summary, naming your first HTML file as index.html makes your website accessible to users, follows industry standards, and aids in the ease of understanding your project's structure. It's important to note, however, that this can be configured differently on the server-side if needed, but doing so without a specific reason may lead to unnecessary confusion.

### A Simple HTML Document
Inside the `index.html` write:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

**Example Explained**
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page
The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The `<h1>` element defines a large heading
The `<p>` element defines a paragraph

### What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
`<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>`

The **HTML element** is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
```

3. In finder double click on `index.html` and it will open it up in your defult browser. You should now see our HTML rendered in the browser! 
<img width="1317" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 14 10 31" src="https://github.com/michaelbarley/new-starter-demo-project/assets/50404794/8bb3f18a-06f8-469c-9d15-d36ea4258ae4">

4. Now lets update our `index.html` with a few new tags, modify `index.html` `<head>` like so: 
```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Nike - Just Do It</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="image/logo.png">
</head>
```

let's break down each of these tags:

`<meta charset="UTF-8">`: The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata isn't displayed on the page but is machine parsable. In this case, the charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes all characters from all writing systems, so it's good practice to use this to support international characters and symbols.

`<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">`: This `<meta>` tag is used for compatibility with Internet Explorer. It tells IE to display the webpage in the highest mode available, thus ensuring the webpage uses the latest rendering engine. edge means the very latest version that IE has to offer.

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This `<meta>` tag is used for responsive web design. It sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`: The `<link>` tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. In this case, it's linking to an external CSS file (style.css) which provides the styles for the HTML document. The rel attribute specifies the relationship as a "stylesheet".

`<link rel="shortcut icon" href="image/logo.png">`: This `<link>` tag is used to specify a shortcut icon or favicon for the HTML document. The favicon is a small icon that appears in the browser tab next to the webpage's title. The href attribute specifies the path to the image file.

### Navigation Bar
5. Within our `<body>` place this code: 
```html
    <section>
        <nav>
            <div class="logo">
                <h1>Shoe<span>s</span></h1>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#Home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Products">Products</a></li>
                <li><a href="#About">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Review">Review</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Servises">Servises</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </section>
```

let's break down each of these tags:

`<section>`: The `<section>` tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
  
`<nav>`: The `<nav>` tag defines a set of navigation links. Using this tag helps search engines understand the structure of the website. It is intended for major block of navigation links, not for scattered links within the page.

`<div class="logo">`: The `<div>` tag is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections. It can be styled with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) or manipulated with JavaScript. In this case, it's used to contain the logo of the page. The class attribute is used to point to a class name in a style sheet.

`<h1>Shoe<span>s</span></h1>`: The `<h1>` tag is used to indicate the main heading of a page, and should be the title of the whole content. The <span> tag is used to group inline-elements in a document. Here, it's used to separate the "s" in "Shoes" for potential styling purposes.

`<ul>`: The `<ul>` tag stands for Unordered List, and it is used to create a list of items marked with bullets (typically round black circles).

`<li><a href="#Home">Home</a></li>`: The `<li>` tag stands for List Item, and is used in conjunction with lists. Inside the list items, `<a>` tags are used for creating hyperlinks. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. In this case, "#" indicates that it's a link to a specific section of the current page.

Note that the `<nav>` tag is not required for all lists of links, but is useful for identifying blocks of major navigation links, and can be particularly helpful in accessibility as it allows screen readers to understand the context of the links.

6. Now you should see this in your browser
  <img width="476" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 14 27 36" src="https://github.com/michaelbarley/new-starter-demo-project/assets/50404794/69580b80-5c02-417b-9d56-f0c8e4d247f8">
 
### Header
Within the same `<section>` tag as your nag but underneath it place this:
```html
        <div class="main" id="Home">
            <div class="main_content">
                <div class="main_text">
                    <h1>NIKE<br><span>Collection</span></h1>
                    <p>
                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has 
                        been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took 
                        a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
                        five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="main_image">
                    <img src="image/shoes.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="button">
                <a href="#">SHOP NOW</a>
            </div>
        </div>
```

let's break down each of these tags:

`<div class="main" id="Home">`: This is a div tag, which we've previously discussed. It's being assigned two attributes: a class and an id. The class, "main", can be used to apply styling to this element and any other elements with the same class. The id, "Home", is unique to this element and can be used to target this specific element for CSS or JavaScript. The id also allows this section of the webpage to be directly linked to with a URL that ends in #Home.

`<div class="main_content">`: This div tag is used as a container for grouping together the textual content and the image of the main section. The class "main_content" can be used to style this container.

`<div class="main_text">`: This div tag contains the heading and paragraph for the main section. The class "main_text" can be used to apply styling to this content.

`<h1>NIKE<br><span>Collection</span></h1>`: Here, an h1 tag is used to define the most important heading in the main section. Inside this h1 tag, there is a br tag used to create a line break, and a span tag to distinguish the word "Collection" for unique styling.

`<p>`: The p tag is used to hold the paragraph text for this section.

`<div class="main_image">`: This div tag is used to contain the image for the main section. The class "main_image" can be used to style this container.

`<img src="image/shoes.png">`: The img tag is used to embed an image into the webpage. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file. In this case, the image file is named "shoes.png" and it is located in an "image" folder in the same directory as the HTML file.

`<div class="button">`: This div tag is used as a container for the button and its associated icon. The class "button" can be used to style this element.

`<a href="#">SHOP NOW</a>`: This is an anchor tag (a tag) which is used to create a clickable link. In this case, it's being used to create a "SHOP NOW" button. The href attribute normally specifies the URL that the link leads to. The "#" value is a placeholder and means that this link doesn't actually go anywhere at the moment.

 ### Styling our Navigation Bar And Header
 So far we have the basic structure of our site thanks to HTML, but you must admit, its very **ugly** lets style our HTML elements using CSS üî•

 ### What is CSS
CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

### CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

`<h1>This is a heading</h1>`

`<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

When tags like `<font>`, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
  
 ### CSS Syntax
 A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
<img width="612" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 14 47 32" src="https://github.com/michaelbarley/new-starter-demo-project/assets/50404794/27d8bf11-39d5-44f3-9b53-5ba46e8db0de">

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
