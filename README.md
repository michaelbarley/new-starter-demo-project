## Introduction
Becoming a software engineer can be overwhelming! You will hear so many different languages and frameworks being mentioned that you may think, what on earth have I signed myself up for. 

But dont worry, We have **all** been there üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

I have purposely designed this demo project to take you through the **basics** and slowly move onto more advanced concepts as we progress our skills and when it feels right, instead of throwing everything at you all at once.  

## Course Structure 
A break down of the course is: 
- **Project Breif**  - Here we will describe what we are going to be building together, I will show you the completed project Blue Peter style.

**Objective**: The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and visually appealing landing page for an e-commerce store that primarily sells Nike trainers.

**Description**: The landing page will be simple but detailed, comprising several sections. Each section will serve a specific purpose and contribute to the overall user experience:

- **Hero Section**: The introductory section will captivate visitors with an attractive headline, sub-heading, and a compelling call-to-action (CTA) button.
  
- **Product Display Section**: There will be dedicated areas to showcase a variety of Nike trainers, both popular and new arrivals, to cater to different customer preferences.

- **About Section**: A section that provides information about the e-commerce store and its mission. This will help to build a stronger connection with customers and foster trust in the brand.

- **Review Section**: This section will exhibit customer testimonials and ratings, helping to build trust among potential buyers.
Services Section: This area will highlight the e-commerce store's unique selling propositions such as fast delivery, a 10-day replacement policy, and round-the-clock customer support.
