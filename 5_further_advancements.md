# Further Advancements
Well done you made it to the end of this course! In just a short period of time we have covered so much. It is however, almost impossible to cover everything and the majority of knoweldge does come from working on your own, adding features, getting stuck and investigating new technoligies/ways of solving problems

With that in mind, using the knowledge you have gained throughout all the previous sections. I think that working on these additional features by your self will really improve your skills.

1. **Individual Product details page**: Currently products are just displayed all together on the homepage, it would be really good if you could click into them and be on a completely seperate page just for that product. Each product has a `id` which you can pass into the backend in order to retrieve just that products infomation. In terms of front end, you could do some learning around `vue-router` there are many tutorials on the internet about how to set this up. Basically vue-router allows us to link to different pages in a vue application.
