**Title**: E-commerce Store Landing Page Development for Nike Trainers

**Objective**: The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and visually appealing landing page for an e-commerce store that primarily sells Nike trainers.

**Description**: The landing page will be simple but detailed, comprising several sections. Each section will serve a specific purpose and contribute to the overall user experience:

- **Hero Section**: The introductory section will captivate visitors with an attractive headline, sub-heading, and a compelling call-to-action (CTA) button.
  
- **Product Display Section**: There will be dedicated areas to showcase a variety of Nike trainers, both popular and new arrivals, to cater to different customer preferences.

- **About Section**: A section that provides information about the e-commerce store and its mission. This will help to build a stronger connection with customers and foster trust in the brand.

- **Review Section**: This section will exhibit customer testimonials and ratings, helping to build trust among potential buyers.
Services Section: This area will highlight the e-commerce store's unique selling propositions such as fast delivery, a 10-day replacement policy, and round-the-clock customer support.

- **Login Form**: A simple and secure login form for users to access their accounts.
  
- **Footer Section**: The footer will contain important links and information including contact details, FAQ, shipping and return policies, and payment options. Additionally, a newsletter subscription form will be provided to engage users in a long-term relationship.

## Work Items
Work-items are essentially the smaller tasks that make up a larger project or goal. The concept of work-items comes from agile development methodologies, which focus on iterative and incremental delivery of software. Breaking down a project into smaller, manageable tasks, or "work-items," is a key aspect of this approach.

Here's why we break tasks down into work-items:

**Manageability**: Large projects can be overwhelming. By breaking the project down into smaller work-items, the tasks become more manageable. Each work-item can be tackled independently, making the work more approachable and less daunting.

**Organization**: Work-items help to keep the project organized. They can be tracked, prioritized, and managed individually, which makes the project as a whole easier to oversee.

**Estimation**: By breaking down the project into work-items, it's easier to estimate how long each part of the project will take. This can help with scheduling and resource allocation.

**Progress Tracking**: Work-items allow for easy progress tracking. When a work-item is completed, it's a clear indication of progress being made on the project. This not only keeps the team aware of where they are but also provides a motivational boost.

**Flexibility**: If the project needs to change direction or scope, having individual work-items makes it easier to adjust. Tasks can be added, removed, or re-prioritized without affecting the entire project.

**Collaboration**: Work-items can be assigned to different team members based on their skills and capabilities, promoting collaboration and efficient utilization of resources.

In essence, work-items make large projects more manageable, organized, and adaptable. They support efficient tracking of progress and resource allocation, and foster a collaborative work environment.
